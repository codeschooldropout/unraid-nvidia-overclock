<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Decided to change mining computer into backup / test Unraid NAS but still wanted to mine.

Initially wanted to try GPU passthrough to a VM to avoid nvidia-settings on headless system but that didn't work out.

Found and adjusted [unraid-nvidia-overclock.sh](https://gist.github.com/gabrielsond/eea673568c17ff9a4b904cd0eb22760e) to work with Unraid 6.10rc4 test release
